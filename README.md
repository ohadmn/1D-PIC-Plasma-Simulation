# 1D-PIC-Plasma-Simulation
"A Python-based simulation of plasma dynamics using the Particle-In-Cell (PIC) method in a one-dimensional electrostatic framework. This repository replicates and expands on the work by Gomez, Hoyos, and Valdivia, featuring simulations of Langmuir waves and plasma instabilities with Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution."
